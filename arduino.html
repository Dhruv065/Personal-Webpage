  <h1>Arduino Project: Whack-a-Mole Game</h1>
  <p><strong>By:</strong> Dhruv Hukkeri</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Our project was a custom-built <em>Whack-a-Mole</em> arcade game using an Arduino UNO. 
      Instead of plastic moles, we used paper cups with LEDs in front of them. 
      When the LED lit up, the player had to hit the cup. A shock sensor detected the hit, 
      and the Arduino registered it as a <strong>hit</strong> (if within the LED’s time window) 
      or a <strong>miss</strong>. An OLED screen displayed the score live.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Working Principle</h2>
    <p>
      Each cup was fitted with a balloon surface attached to a <strong>shock sensor</strong>. 
      When hit, the sensor sent a digital signal to the Arduino UNO. 
      If the strike matched the LED’s active time, it was recorded as a hit, otherwise as a miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game included multiple difficulty levels: <em>Noob</em>, <em>Intermediate</em>, 
      <em>Pro</em>, and <em>God</em>, where the LED timing and pause duration decreased, 
      making the game progressively harder.
    </p>

    <h2>Shock Sensor Module</h2>
    <p>
      A shock sensor has three pins: Ground, +5V, and Signal. During a shock event, 
      the switch closes and sends a high signal to the Arduino, enabling detection of hits.

    <h2>Execution</h2>
    <p>
      The Arduino code randomly selected an LED to light up for 0.5 seconds. 
      If the corresponding shock sensor detected a hit in time, a point was added. 
      The game lasted for one minute, with score displayed on an OLED screen. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Possible extensions included randomizing LED-on time and penalizing misses 
      with negative points.

    <h2>Sample Code Snippet</h2>
    <pre><code>
int red1In = 2; 
int red1Out = 7; 
int mole = -1;
int hits = 0;

void loop() {
  mole = rand() % 4 + 1;  // Pick random mole
  digitalWrite(red1Out, HIGH);
  delay(500); // LED active
  if (digitalRead(red1In) == LOW && mole == 1) {
    hits++;
    Serial.println("Hit!");
  }
}
    </code></pre>
