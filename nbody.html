  <h1>Cosmological N-body Simulations</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Cosmological N-body simulations are the primary tool to study how structure 
    forms in the universe under the influence of gravity. In these simulations, 
    the dark matter distribution is represented by billions of particles, 
    each tracing the motion of a small fraction of the cosmic mass. Starting 
    from initial conditions set by the early universe — consistent with the 
    cosmic microwave background and ΛCDM cosmology — the simulation evolves 
    forward in time using Newton’s laws of motion and gravity.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the universe expands, small fluctuations in density grow through 
    gravitational instability, eventually forming the nonlinear cosmic web of 
    filaments, sheets, and halos. Within this framework, galaxies and clusters 
    reside inside dark matter halos, whose structure can be directly compared 
    with observations through gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering, and 
    rotation curves.
  </p>
  <p>
    N-body simulations are especially valuable for testing alternative dark matter 
    models. By adjusting interaction properties, box sizes, and resolution, we can 
    explore how halo profiles and collapse timescales change across different 
    physical scenarios. In my work, I use high-resolution simulations tailored to 
    study intermediate-mass halos, bridging the gap between dwarf galaxies and 
    massive clusters.
  </p>

<h2>Simulation Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Code:</strong> GADGET-2</li>
  <li><strong>Box size:</strong> 500 Mpc/h</li>
  <li><strong>Number of particles:</strong> 1024³</li>
  <li><strong>Mass resolution:</strong> ~5 × 10⁹ M<sub>⊙</sub> per particle</li>
  <li><strong>Halo finder:</strong> Rockstar</li>
  <li><strong>Cosmology:</strong> Planck ΛCDM parameters
    <ul>
      <li>Ω<sub>m</sub> = 0.307115</li>
      <li>Ω<sub>Λ</sub> = 0.692885</li>
      <li>Ω<sub>b</sub> = 0.048206</li>
      <li>h = 0.6777</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The smaller 500 Mpc box compared to typical 1000 Mpc runs provides higher 
  mass resolution, ensuring halos of mass 10<sup>13</sup>–10<sup>14</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> 
  are resolved with tens of thousands of particles each.

<h3>Formation of the Cosmic Web</h3>

The video above shows the large-scale formation of the cosmic web in the 500 Mpc/h box. 
Initially small fluctuations grow under gravity into filaments, sheets, and nodes. 
These structures host the halos where galaxies and clusters eventually form.

<h3>Effect of Self-Interaction Cross Section</h3>

     alt="Density profiles for different sigma values" 
     style="max-width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin:20px 0;">
<p>
Here we compare stacked density profiles of halos for different self-interaction 
cross-sections (σ). Increasing σ systematically reduces the central density, 
demonstrating the coring effect of self-interactions. At larger radii, the 
profiles remain nearly identical, showing that SIDM mainly alters the inner halo.
From the 1000 halos in the mass range 10<sup>13</sup>–10<sup>14</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, 
we compute stacked density profiles. This improves the signal-to-noise and allows 
direct comparison with theoretical models and observational probes such as weak lensing. 
The profiles reveal how SIDM-induced coring becomes more prominent at small radii, 
while preserving the outer structure.
